    <textOnly>Hi {!User.Name}!
Before anything, I would like to apologize for the extreme delay in the submission of the assessment. To be totally honest when I finished it, I forgot to do the final steps.
The assessment was completed on Saturday the 10th. It took me around 35-40 hours.
The url for the GIT repository is here.
Kind regards, Carlos Alvarado</textOnly>
